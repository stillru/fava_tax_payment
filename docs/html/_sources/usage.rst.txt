Tagging Transactions
--------------------

The extension identifies tax transactions in two ways:

1. Via transaction metadata:

.. code-block:: text

   2023-04-15 * "Monthly Tax Payment"
       Expenses:Taxes:Income  1000.00 RSD
           tax_type: "income"
       Assets:Bank:Checking

2. Via transaction narration matching tax type name:

.. code-block:: text

   2023-04-15 * "income"
       Expenses:Taxes:Income  1000.00 RSD
       Assets:Bank:Checking
